\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}{}  % mette l'introduzione nell'indice

The first part of the introduction is the abstract of the thesis, 
which contains an itroductive summary of the whole work, 
without the actual results.
The summary must contain only the main points, 
leaving to the thesis description all the details of the implementation,
of the techniques used, 
of specific effects.
In the introduction, only the main physics motivation
and the key elements of the study need to be reported.

The second part of the introduction
is the list of chapters presented later on, 
with one-paragraph description of the content of each of them, 
such that the reader is aware of what to expect.

A useful introduction on how to use \LaTeXe{} can be found at this reference~\cite{NSS}.
