\chapter{Title of the Second Chapter}

The second part in which a thesis is divided into
contains the specific introduction to the work performed.
The specific physics context shall be described,
for example in terms of what process has been studied,
what are its characteristics,
peculiarities
and main challenges in its study.
From the experimental point of view, 
a description will be presented for 
the data taking conditions, 
the particle reconstruction,
or the events simulation.
Concerning the extraction of the results,
the tools utilised will be presented, 
for example when used to isolate signal over background,
or to fit distributions to extract the final result,
or to develop the best reconstruction for a given quantity of interest.
